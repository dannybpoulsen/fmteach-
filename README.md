#  FMTeach++  
Formal Methods in computer science is often taught to students with a
focus on the theoretical aspects of formal methods i.e. the modelling
formalisms, correctness of algorithms and so on.  Students are given
practical experience through using tools that implements modelling
formalisms and the algorithms. This is great for giving students
practical experience in applying formal methods, but it fails to give
students hands-on experience in implementing the formal methods that
they have been taught. 

This is highly unsatisfactory as many learn computer science/software
students understands best by coding. FMTeach++ is a set of exercises
that attempts to give students practical in implementing the
algorithms they have been taught in the their course.
