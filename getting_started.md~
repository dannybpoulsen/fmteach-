# Getting Started
## Building
Before getting started you need to compile FMTeach++. 

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Solving Exercises  
All exercises in FMTeach++ requires adding code to the repository.  

After having compiled FMTeach++ will have a binary in `build/bin/fmteach`. This binary is your entry point to the exercises.

## Running your solution to an exercise

After solving an exercise `exercisename` in the repository, you can use the  `fmteach` binary to run your solution on a program `program.whiley`   
 
```bash 
fmteach --i program.whiley --e exercisename
```
